<div id="intro">
With every little change in the search engine algorithms the discussion arises, if SEO might be dead. 
As the ranking functionality shift more and more towards a machine learning- based approach, the topic gains a new level of interest. Looking forward, we ask ourselves: What does SEO bring to the year 2018? What can Marketers do in order to keep track with the pace of developments? Which influence do AI- based algorithms like Google's RankBrain bring to modern and future SEO? To keep things short, SEO isn't dead, and it won't be in the next years. Nevertheless, it has undergone some major changes in the last years. Let's take a look back on the history of SEO.
</div>

<h1>From keyword stuffing to content optmization</h1>

<h2>Keywords</h2>

<div>
Google's search engine started with an algorithm, that focused solely on certain keywords. For the keyword(s) a user is looking for, the engine created an search engine results page (SERP) by matching the keywords to an index.
Indexes, in the sense of SEO are data stores for all types of content - texts, pictures, videos and others. Whereas owners of a website had to register for those indexes back in the days, Google then started to automate this process, making a seperate registration obsolete. Websites were crawled for usable content, a process that today is updated every 24 hours. To make a website relevant for Google's algorithms, one had to make sure, that the keywords users were looking for appeared on the site in a high quantity. The result was what we know as "keyword stuffing" - an excessive use of keywords, especially in title and description forms of the pages. Later on, also domains were crawled for keywords. This caused a development of more meaningful domain names, ideally including several of the most important keywords for that page. Keywords can be of different kind, such as brand- related or generic keywords. Especially for the latter category, Google had problems to rank pages accurately, as they were not able to understand the meaning behind them. A search for a white toothbrush could bring a completely different SERP as a serach for a red toothbrush, even though the color was not relevant for a buying decision.
</div>

<h2>Links and Social media</h2>

<div>
Next, Google added links as a factor for its search algorithms. A site that contained links to other websites and that other sites linked onto was identified as a high- quality page, regardless of the perceived quality of those other sites. For this reason, Marketers started building big networks, in which websites just linked back and forth to get high rankings. That was fixed some time later, when Google also measured the "quality" of the linked pages. With the rise of social media, the appearance of one's website could be measured in another form. Not only links were taken into account, but also sharings and links from social platforms. From now on, the content of a certain website was a deciding factor for the search engines: Pages, who where frequently updated and presented appealing content with different (at that time in the Internet quite new) formats as video were ranked a lot higher.
</div>

<h2>RankBrain</h2>

<div>
Today, Google's algorithms decide autonomously on the ranking of websites based on a huge amount of factors, which are applied to the data in the indexes. All of the above mentioned factors, alongside with technical attributes as the crawling- compability are taken into account. But with its RankBrain, Google made an interesting change in the search engine functionality: Instead of static factors that are analysed and matched between the users keywords and the indexes, Google is now capable of actually understanding more and more of the coherent phrases an individual is searching for. Machine Learning has essentially helped to develop algorithms making this change possible.
</div>

<h1>A new generation of search engines with Machine Learning</h1>

<div>
Google's RankBrain is a Machine Learning algorithm, which is capable of "understanding" full keyword phrases. The system, that was implemented at the end of 2015 is trained on basis of historical data and can comprehend semantic coherences with the help of the Hummingbird update. Hummingbird was one of the major changes in the engine's functionality, that today impacts most of all searches. After this update, Google was able to not only look at certain keywords individually, but to combine words logically and interpret its semantic meaning. Also, typos in the queries could be detected and replaced by the phrase a user probably wanted to type in. Hummingbird provided a completely new way of intelligence, however its procession of unknown keyword combinations was more than insufficient. In fact, more than 15% of all present search queries never have been typed before. This is where Machine Learning comes into play: Based on historic data, it can guess what a user probably wanted to find out, even if the keywords entered do not appear in a certain website. If an invidivual wanted to find out about "non- alcoholic drinks", Google now can not only link data to the indexes that contain these very keywords, but can simply show "lemonades" or "juices". This way, the SERP gets bigger - including more possible solutions: It can provide the user with more content that probably matches his interest. Even personal data can be integrated into the search automatically. As Google stores personal and behavioral data about its users, these can be taken into account aswell. Google aims to understand autonomously the situation of the user: Under which circumstances might he be looking for what? For this reason, Google can access and factor in data on the user's current position, the actual time, buying behavior and relationships to other people.
</div>

<h2>Changes for Marketers in 2018</h2>

<div>
Today, RankBrain is only managing a small fraction of all search queries, but its expansion to other parts of searches is more than likely. As Machine Learning takes over more and more existing processes in several branches and often comes with a never before seen accuracy, it could also process known keyword phrases in the future. This would not only improve the quality of the searching process as we know it, but also alter the overall functionality. An even larger implementation of AI- based algorithms will probably lead to a new scope of the personalized search. Google will be able to understand more about the user and thus offer a more conveniant functionality - also due to enhanced features as the voice recognition.
</div>
<br><br>
<div>
What does all of this mean for Marketers? Of course, a more accurate search functionality makes it more difficult to create Spam. "Content is king" is now true more than ever. Google's most important aim is to match the search queries with the most interesting results. Therefore, Marketers need to provide the most interesting, and preferrably also the most unique content possible. For websites, that are barely optimized to the common SEO standards, Google even started to optimize the pages by itself, if it could recognize valueable content on it. For instance, if no description for a certain subpage exists, or if its content simply doesn't fit to the rest of the page, Google presents the site in the SERP with a self- generated description. Also, it is to consider, that a search engine is just a pre- qualifying channel. A lot of clicks won't be advantageous, if the content is not really appealing. Not being able to produce longclicks will make Google punish the website owners by taking away their good rankings. Websites that are far away from good rankings will barely have these kind of problems, nevertheless they rely on qualitative content in the same way.
</div>

<h2>Content that is relevant</h2>

<div>
This does not undermine the importance of the traditional SEO factors. Today, your website needs to fullfill all criteria of "traditional" SEO in order to guarantee good rankings. But you cannot rely on them any more. 
Your content must be of high value for a certain group of people. What exactly does this mean? You should be asking yourself: 
</div>

<img id="bigidea" src="{{site.baseurl}}/media/imgs/icons_logos/lightbulb.png">
<p id="bloggyhighlight">
Which valueable information can I deliver to what audience(s) where and at which time?
</p>

<div>
This brief question implies, that you need to have the resources to deliver a certain type of information. In that sense, your scope of content delivery is limited by the background of your business. If you present content just to adress an interesting target group, but this content doesn't match with your business image, you will loose credibility and with that your ranking. The following questions might be useful to ask yourself in order to get insights into the process of qualitative content creation:
</div>


<ol id="bloggylist">
<li>What <b id="bloggylistb">image</b> does your site represent? What are you known for?</li>
<li>What kind of <b id="bloggylistb">content</b> are you capable to deliver in a unique way?</li>
<li>What types of <b id="bloggylistb">audiences</b> might be interested in this content and why? Can you group/ cluster them?</li>
<li>How do the factors <b id="bloggylistb">time and location</b> influence the audence's search behavior? </li>
<li>Can you identify <b id="bloggylistb">patterns</b> in the audience's search behavior?</li>
</ol>


<div id="protipp">
<b>Tip:</b> In order to understand your actual position in the search engine rankings you might use Google Search Console, that monitors your SEO performance. Identifying audiences can be a sophisticated procedure aswell, but a keyword databse can give you a glimpse of an idea on what type of keywords people are looking for. Try to match these information and to identify logically linked fields of interst, that your website can serve. You should aim to provide information that presents benefits/ upsides of a topic (positive/ transformational motives) and/ or that solves the problem of a reader (negative/ informational motives), depending on the type of your offers. Transformational motives usually apply best to emotional topics, whereas the latter category rather matches informational ones by implication.
</div>

<br>

<div>
In the end, it will be interesting to look into the future of SEO. What we can prognosticate for sure, is a more personalised and content- focused approach that will challenge Marketers even more to know their customers and provide them with the best tailored and most extraordinary content possible.
