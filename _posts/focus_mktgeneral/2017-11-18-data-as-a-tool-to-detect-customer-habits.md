Hummingbird was one of the major changes in the engine's functionality, that today impacts most of all searches. After this update, Google was able to not only look at certain keywords individually, but to combine words logically and interpret its semantic meaning. Also, typos in the queries could be detected and replaced by the phrase a user probably wanted to type in. Hummingbird provided a completely new way of intelligence, however its procession of unknown keyword combinations was more than insufficient. In fact, more than 15% of all present search queries never have been typed before. This is where Machine Learning comes into play: Based on historic data, it can guess what a user probably wanted to find out, even if the keywords entered do not appear in a certain website. If an invidivual wanted to find out about "non- alcoholic drinks", Google now can not only link data to the indexes that contain these very keywords, but can simply show "lemonades" or "juices". This way, the SERP gets bigger - including more possible solutions: It can provide the user with more content that probably matches his interest. Even personal data can be integrated into the search automatically. As Google stores personal and behavioral data about its users, these can be taken into account as
